# SeasoningShack
A website for the ficticious restaurant Seasoning Shack, showcasing casual and multinational cuisine. Original Project was done as a group project for school. Now this static website will be the launchpad for experimenting with Vue JS. 

## Objective
The goal is to fix responsiveness and eventually convert it to using Vue JS.
